	TO DO
	-----

+ UTF-7

+ Windows Symbol font

! make a better cp1258 which recognizes combined accents

+ make also a conversion _from_ TeX

* translate konwert from perl into C to make it faster

+ doc/{en/history,pl/historia} describing why Konwert has been written

+ let programs talk in a national language (through gettext)

+ ISO-2022

+ various far East encodings

! investigate which SGML entities are be not official and should not be
  used in htmlent's output

* make some testing scripts to ensure that nothing important has got
  broken

+ allow specifying the list of directories scanned for filters in an
  environment variable or maybe also in a config file

?* it would be convenient if the documentation in various formats
   (currently txt and man) could be generated from a single source;
   maybe SGML?

+ TeX's babel encodings also for some languages other than Polish

+ trs rules that substitute a string and translate it again; or possibly
  translate some part of the substituted string

+ support \- character ranges in fixtrsutf8; use it in rosyjski

?+ some kind of regexps in trs; this would require redesigning the whole
   trs

+ make 512bold's palette configurable

?+ find if there are some conventions for escaping punctuation in viqri

?+ viqri input for filterm

+ something like `|' regexp in trs, which expands similarly to
  fixtrsutf8, duplicating a rule using several variants in the given
  place

?+ macros in trs

! preserve hard links, using md5

+ allow passing escaped + - / in filters' arguments
