	BUGS
	----

`make uninstall' deletes the whole share/konwert and lib/konwert
directories, even if there are some files there that are not ours.
It's not easy to build the explicit list of files to be deleted.

APPLE character in mac* charsets, and CH and ch characters in koi8cs are
not preserved in conversion even when they are available. Also they
don't respect the /1 option. Reason: they are not in Unicode.

Hard links should be used when several files share the same body,
differing their behaviour by their name. They are used in source
files, but later they are not preserved by the installation.

mkUTF8-ascii would be run once for generating both UTF8-ascii and
UTF8-ascii1 if I knew how to specify one command making multiple
targets in a Makefile.

512bold filter is not perfect. Some escape sequences may be emulated
incorrectly. Additionally, colors changed in multiple steps or not used
unnecessarily allocate some of the eight colors.

fixtrsutf8 doesn't support `\-' ranges.
