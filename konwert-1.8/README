	DOCUMENTATION

Polish documentation is in the doc/pl directory.

Known bugs in current version are in the doc/en/BUGS file.

Changes in each version are described in the doc/en/CHANGES file.

Plans for future are listed in the doc/en/TODO file.

The package consists of the following components:

The konwert program itself is an interface for various file filters.
It allows filtering multiple files through multiple filters. Filters can
be any executables. See the doc/en/konwert file for details.

The trs program is the real engine converting character sets. It can
replace given strings with another ones and not much more. See the
doc/en/trs file for details.

The filterm program filters the terminal innput or output, which can
help e.g. when our terminal is unable to display non-ASCII characters or
to enter them with keyboard. See the doc/en/filterm file for details.

Some filters are provided, mainly for conversion between various
character sets and encodings of extended characters. See the
doc/en/filters file for details.

New filters can be easily added. I've included some source files for
filters, and scripts used to build those filters from them. See the
doc/en/devel file for details.

For information about sources of tables, thanks and how could you help
me, see the doc/en/thanks file.


	INSTALLATION

Konwert runs under Linux, and probably under other Unices as well. Perl
5.001 or later is required.

If you are installing from sources:

Run `make install' in the Konwert source directory.

You can specify base directory other than the default /usr/local:
`make install prefix=/usr' or whatever. This directory will be written
into the installed bin/konwert script, which will search for its filters
there. Files are installed under the subdirectories bin, share/konwert,
lib/konwert, doc/konwert-1.8 and man of the base directory.

The directory of perl interpreter will also be written into the
installed scripts. If you want to use different perl than the one found
by `which perl', `make install perl=/usr/bin/perl' (with the proper
path).

If the package is to be installed in some other place than the target
one, `make prefix=...' will write the proper directory into scripts and
`make install prefix=...' can then install into a different place.

Changing this directory after building the package, or the perl path,
requires `make clean' between.

`make uninstall' does what it is supposed to. It requires the same
prefix= option as `make install'.
